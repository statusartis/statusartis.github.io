It is the most important thermal insulation of the building. More than 50% of a building\u0026rsquo;s heat loss is due to a lack of proper roof insulation. Installation of thermal facade. The thermal facade reduces on the one hand the heat losses from the building shell, on the other hand it does not prevent the creation of cracks and the wear of the materials from the contractions due to the temperature changes. Finally, the painted surface has a longer life than the corresponding exterior oil painting. Replacement of frames. Modern frames with thermal break system reduce heat loss by up to 30% compared to classic aluminum frames. We install the most reliable series of thermal break windows. The customer can choose from a wide variety of aluminum and PVC products.
